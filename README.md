An application that uses Interception and snippets of code adapted from Libpointer to apply the Windows mouse filters to raw mouse input.
This can be used in order to make mouse movements feel more familiar in applications that force raw input.
In order to run it, you will have to install Interception (http://www.oblita.com/interception.html) and copy interception.dll to the folder containing the application binary.
The application loads settings from profile.txt by default, but you can specify a different (relative) path as an argument.
